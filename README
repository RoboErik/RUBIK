Requirements for running on Pi

1) install dependencies
sudo apt-get install python-dev # Needed to build/debug python projects
sudo apt-get install scons # Used by NeoPixel makefile
sudo apt-get install swig # Used in installation

2) build rpi_ws281x
cd Rubik/RubikSolver/rpi_ws281x # NeoPixel library
scons

3) setup python wrapper for rpi
sudo apt-get install python-dev swig
cd python
python setup.py build

4) make RUBIK/run.sh executable
# cd to root of project
chmod +x run.sh

5) Copy the correct image files up to Assets
# normal - standard images with no modifications
# stretched - images stretched a little for if the screen resolution is off
# flipped - upside down images, ignore
cd Rubik/Assets
cp <directory>/* .

Running:
./run.sh

# To set it up to run on boot
chmod +x run_start.sh
pico /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
# add "@bash /home/pi/pywork/RUBIK/run_start.sh 2>/tmp/rerr.txt" to autostart
# Be sure to change pywork/RUBIK/ to whatever directory run_start.sh is in

# To set up the splash screen both of these need to be done to show as long as possible

# To flip screen add the following to /boot/config.txt. See https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=120793

# If audio doesn't work the only thing that seems to help is modprobe.
# This is now part of sounds.py
sudo modprobe snd-bcm2835
# Also tried uncommenting in boot/config.txt
hdmi_drive=2
# And adding it to modules
sudo pico /etc/modules
# Add snd-bcm2835 and save
